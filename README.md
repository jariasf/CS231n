# CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition - Assignment Solutions


This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2018).

Find course notes and assignments [here](http://cs231n.github.io) and be sure to check out the video lectures for [Winter 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) and [Spring 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk)!

Assignments using Tensorflow are completed, those using Pytorch will be implemented in the future.
